- This is something I will need: dnorm(0, mean=4, sd=10)

- There are 3 subsetting operators: [, [[, and $. You need [[ when working with lists. This is because when [ is applied
to a list it always returns a list: it never gives you the contents of the
list. To get the contents, you need [[.

- So, here we have found 2 ways to add a "diff" column to our data frame. 
1) df_result$diff <- abs((df_result$meanFault - df_result$meanNoFault) / df_result$meanNoFault) * 100
2) df_result <- transform(df_result, diff = round(abs((df_result$meanFault - df_result$meanNoFault) / df_result$meanNoFault) * 100, 3))

- apply, tapply(), sapply(), mappy(), and lapply(). WTF?

- I currently use [] to filter data. Note that filter and subset (and who knows what else!) can pretty much do the same thing. But what's better, I wonder?
These two do the same thing, I think.
1) fault <- trainData[trainData$Label == 1, ] (I kinda like this one better, even though the line is a little longer!)
2) fault <- filter(trainData, Label == 1) 

- I currently use read_csv to import data from .CSV file. 
Is it really better to use fread according to this link https://rawgit.com/wiki/Rdatatable/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html?
